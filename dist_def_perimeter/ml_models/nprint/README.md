## Code

`train_test_nprint`: using nprint features to test and train using RandomForest for classification

`train_test_tshark`: using tshark features to test and training using RandomForst for classification

`tshark_features_1.py`: extract tshark features from PCAP file in parallel

`tshark_features_2.py`: extract tshark features only from numerical/hex fields

The actual nprint code can be found at https://github.com/nprint/nprint

## Datasets
For datasets we used available PCAPs from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/index.html. In addition, some of our own PCAP file for devices that we have in the IoT lab can be accessed at https://yourthings.info/data/
