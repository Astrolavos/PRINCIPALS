# PRINCIPALS

PRINCIPALS is a framework for securing 5G and other SDN-enabled networks that balances *safety* and *flexibility*.
PRINCIPALS was developed as part of DARPA's [OPS-5G program](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/open-programmable-secure-5g).
This repository contains DCO for use with the PRINCIPALS [testbed](https://github.com/tolgaoa/oai5gcore_scaling) and [security framework](https://github.com/parasecurity/principals). Some DCO are implemented as standalone demos. 


What's here?
------------
### `dist_def_perimeter`

DCO that utilizes federated learning for anomaly detection and SDN flexibility to propagate threat intelligence to other nodes in the network. 

### `dns_flow_stitching`

DCO that annotates network flow data with DNS labels, at scale. Research paper is under submission, and will be made available once accepted. 

### `malware_network_games`

DCO that detects, isolates, and then interrogates threats through network fuzzing, based on [prior research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2076732.2076734).
